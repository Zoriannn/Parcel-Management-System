# Parcel-Management-System
The Boulevard Parcel Management System is an electronically managed and monitored system designed for the convenient collection of parcels by residents of Boulevard Service Apartment. The system enables residents to register their apartment unit number, owner's full name, contact number and login password to a centralised system. When a parcel is delivered, a one-time PIN code is generated and sent to the recipient through the centralised system. The recipient can retrieve the parcel by checking the PIN code in the centralised system and entering it at the locker station. The system is designed to enhance the convenient lifestyle of community living, making it easier for residents to collect their parcels at their own convenience.
